<h2>our story</h2>
<p>Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) is a state corporation mandated to conserve and manage Kenya’s wildlife, and to enforce relevant Wildlife Conservation and Management Act (WCMA, 2013) laws for the Kenyan people and the world. 

There are a plethora of challenges facing wildlife and biodiversity conservation in Kenya, such as climate change, habitat degradation and loss, forest depletion, tourism market volatility, changing land use, human-wildlife conflict brought on by population growth, and wildlife crime.

Some of the work that KWS does to tackle these challenges includes: 

Protecting and managing national parks, reserves, sanctuaries, and marine parks, where wildlife can thrive in their natural habitats.
 

Conducting research and monitoring on wildlife ecology, behaviour, population and threats, to inform conservation policies and actions.
Providing education and awareness programs to the public, schools, communities and stakeholders, to promote wildlife conservation and coexistence.
Rescuing and rehabilitating orphaned or confiscated wildlife and releasing them back to the wild when possible.
Responding to human-wildlife conflicts such as crop raiding, livestock predation or poaching and providing compensation or mitigation measures.
Collaborating with local and international partners such as NGOs, donors, governments and the private sector to support wildlife conservation initiatives.
